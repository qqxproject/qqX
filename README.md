@ Jan 24 2026  There was an Upstream release, numbered 4.9.8

In reality this is basically a Quickemu catch up exercise:

Most of the 'new' release is actually a consolidation of previous commits made during the last year, so most of the commits are already included in qqX 1.15 and many of the areas addressed in the release were qqX fixed a long time ago ....

The upstream work was somewhat hurried and errors have already been spotted in some of the unreviewed additions that were tacked on during the early hours. But at least some work has happened and some attention has been given to the project.

There are still lots of areas in which upstream is lagging behind.

Expect anything actually new to make its way through to qqX when proper testing and review has taken place, and when fixes have been made ...
