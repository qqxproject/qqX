# qqX  - quickemu quickget X terminal project

SPIN-OFF NEXT LEVEL [QUICKEMU](https://github.com/qqxproject/qqX/blob/main/qqX.builtins/freespirit/quickemu) / [QUICKGET](https://github.com/qqxproject/qqX/blob/main/qqX.builtins/freespirit/quickget)

[Adds fixes, tools and improvements to the popular Quickemu system](https://qqxproject.org/docs/FreeBird)

- Rapid development, simplified interface system, for extra features from Qemu and the Linux desktop

- Allows easy running of Linux, Windows, MacOS, etc with Qemu / KVM

![qqX-vmm](https://github.com/qqxproject/qqX/assets/3956806/18e5c495-8072-49a5-8b9c-e1302549efcf)

- Huge, easy build range of _installation-ready_ distros and desktops

- Comprehensive disk management utilities

- [Fully compatible](https://qqxproject.org/docs/FAQs-and-Help#qqx-and-quickemu-compatibilty) with existing Quickemu builds

-----

Recent Highlights Include:

- **Massive upgrades for QuickGet, that fix, sort and add over 30 distros**

- A new fully automated Windows installer [(now in testing)](https://github.com/qqxproject/qqX/archive/refs/heads/dev-next.zip)

- Multiplexed parallel downloads with enhanced stop/start

- 51 language auto-translation system

Plus numerous downstream fixes for _current_ Quickemu issues

-----

NB for Gnome 49, install `kgx` or use the DEV BRANCH and FREESPIRIT to work around the terminal issue.

- Eg. Ubuntu 25.10 and Fedora 43 workstation etc.  For now, set sizes in the terminal preferences.

Also note that new Quickemu dependency checks have now been added to BOTH branches

- If you are intending TO RUN WINDOWS, dowload using the CODE button, not the release page.

- Use Free SPIRIT for the fast release built-ins, not FreeBird.

CAREFULLY WRITTEN AND CAREFULLY CHECKED

Ordinary users, who are taking a leap of faith, are being rewarded

> After lots of headache with qemu, quickemu, virtmanager etc, I finally found this which worked for me. Thank you. @YehiaEhab17 - issue [#11](https://github.com/qqxproject/qqX/issues/11)

More stars and endorsements hopefully to come

Any qqX built machines will still run using Quickemu and you can always switch or go back to QuickGUI

Developers who understand modern scripting should find the code easy to follow and are welcome to contribute
